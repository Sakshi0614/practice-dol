You must be the change you wish to see in the world.
You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.
A man is but what he knows.
You miss 100 percent of the shots you never take.
If you’re going through hell, keep going.
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do.
